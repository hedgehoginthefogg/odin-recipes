    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe for no-knead sourdough. It takes a couple of days start to finish so plan ahead, but the hands-on labour time is low.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g sourdough starter</li>
        <li>400g flour (I use 200g white, 200g brown)</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the starter, flour water and salt in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon. Leave for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Fold the mixutre with your hands. Leave for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Fold the mixture again with your hands. Leave for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Final time! Fold again and leave uncovered in the bowl for 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Flour a chopping board and put the dough on it. Fold a few times, then leave for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>While you're waiting, clean the bowl and leave to dry.</li>
        <li>Fold again. Line the bowl with baking paper and put the mixture in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture in the fridge, covered, for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to around 230 degrees.</li> 
        <li>Take the bread mixture out of the fridge and score the top with a bread knife. Then put the mixture in a dutch oven, still with the baking paper on. Bake for 35 mins.</li>
        <li>Take the lid off the dutch oven. Bake for a further 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Take the bread out and leave for at least 30 mins before eating.</li>
    </ol>
